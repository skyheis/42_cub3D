# CUB3D: raycasting game in C with minilibx

## Description
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting.
All writed in C with minilibx (a simplified version of the Xlib programming API) for the graphical part.
The game is in 3D view and the player can move in the maze with WASD, you can move the camera with the mouse too. the wall have different textures depending of where they face.
It's a school project, so the norm is strict, and we didn't have the right to use most of the standart library. Also we didn't go deep in the optimisation of the code and of the features. We stay pretty stricted to the subject.
We have to do it in pair programming, we learn a lot about git and how to work in pair, it was a really good experience. Split the work, understand the code of the other, and work together on the same code are some of the things we learn.
